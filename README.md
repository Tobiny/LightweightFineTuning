# Heart Disease Prediction using PEFT

This project uses Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques to adapt a pre-trained BERT model for heart disease prediction.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains the dataset files
- `src/`: Source code for data preparation, model training, and evaluation
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration and result visualization
- `saved_models/`: Directory to store trained models

## Setup

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run data preparation: `python src/data_preparation.py`
4. Train the model: `python src/train.py`
5. Evaluate the model: `python src/evaluate.py`

## Results

(To be updated after model training and evaluation)
