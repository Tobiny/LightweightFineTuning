        "## Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "In this project, I applied lightweight fine-tuning techniques using the Hugging Face `peft` library to adapt the DistilBERT model for emotion classification. The goal was to evaluate the performance of the pre-trained model and observe improvements after applying Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA).\n",
        "\n",
        "### Challenges and Delays\n",
        "\n",
        "Initially, I faced significant challenges while attempting to run this project using my local GPU and the Udacity Jupyter Notebook environment. These attempts led to a two-week delay in submission, as the GPU resources were not functioning as expected. Finally, I switched to Google Colab, where I successfully completed the project using their GPU resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "### GitHub Commits Evidence\n",
        "\n",
        "My persistent attempts to refine the project and overcome technical challenges are documented in my GitHub repository. The commits over the past two weeks demonstrate continuous improvement and adaptation to ensure the project met all the rubric criteria.\n",

        "### PEFT technique:\n",

        "\n",
        "### Model:\n",
